The Goal: Support scholars throughout the research life cycle and expand UC Libraries’ engagement in scholarly communication practices

CDL Responds: Researching and developing incentives and tools for scholars to share their research data

Primary research and community-building efforts by CDL staff over the past year produced multiple publications that help articulate and promote incentives for researchers to share their data.
These articles journals relevant to both the research and library communities, such as _PLOS ONE_, _Scientific Data_, and the inaugural issue of _PeerJ Computer Science_.
They have been widely read and discussed– cumulatively downloaded more than 1,600 times and viewed nearly 20,000 times.
Two papers, _Researcher Perspectives on Publication and Peer Review of Data_ and _Making Data Count_, present the results of surveys of researcher attitudes conducted by the CDL.  
Both investigate what data publications features and metrics would be useful to persuade researchers that sharing data is a valuable and prestigious scholarly activity.
_Data Publication Consensus and Controversies_, comprehensively maps the current landscape of variegated activities taking place under the umbrella term 'data publication,' taking pains to distinguish areas of broad consensus from points of ongoing contention.
The paper presents a characterization of data publication features and processes that is now in use by other organizations (e.g., Dryad).
A central theme running through all three papers is the central role of formal data citation in ensuring that research is reproducible and that researchers who share data are credited for their work.
The importance of data citation is already an area of strong consensus within the scholarly communication community, but implementation has proven difficult.
_Achieving Human and Machine Accessibility of Cited Data in Scholarly Publications_– the output of an international working group led by CDL staff member Joan Starr– offers data repositories detailed technical guidance in make their data accessible and citable.
In spanning primary research, synthesis, and implementation, CD publications have contributed to every stage of the conversation to advance and incentivizing data sharing.


With funding from National Science Foundation Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER), CDL current and former staff John Kratz and Carly Strasser led a research effort to understand the needs and values of both the researchers who create and use data and of the data managers who preserve and publish it.
Making Data Count is a collaborative project between the CDL, PLOS, and DataONE, that has successfully defined and implemented a practical suite of metrics for evaluating the impact of datasets, a necessary prerequisite to widespread recognition of datasets as first class scholarly objects.
