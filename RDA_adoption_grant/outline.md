* Organization / Project
  * CDL / UC3
    * provide centralized digital services to libraries and researchers at the 10 UC system campuses
  * Dash / Merritt
    * data preservation and publication service used by 6/10 campuses
    * Merritt: underlying repository
    * Dash: ingest and discovery layer
    * Dash is an open source project designed to interface via standard protocols with any standards-compliant underlying repository
    * Dash enables researchers from the participating campuses to self-deposit datasets for preservation and publication
    * assigned DOIs, etc.
    * we identified a couple of holes in our service that the RDA could help with
  * user community
    * UC researchers
    * UC libraries
    * researchers, orgs beyond UC


* Certification
  * Problem: Lack of certification, reduced confidence from others _and_ internally
    * we think we're doing a good job, but we have not formally evaluated
      * merritt has been around a while, standards may have evolved past us
      * not sure that we have documented everything as thoroughly as we should have
      * want to be sure that everything is rock-solid by seeking DSA/WDS certification
    * in addition to researchers, we rely on the campus libraries for support
      * libraries would definitely like to know that we're certified
  * Effort: Repository Audit and Certification DSAâ€“WDS Partnership WG Recommendations
    * get DSA certification
    * self-asessment via DSA online tool
    * make any necessary improvements to documentation and processes
      * a preliminary review suggests that our current practices are largely in compliance, and the most significant work will be to document and formalize ad-hoc policies.
    * peer-review
  * Impact / metric of success
    * ultimately, successful certification
    * any changes to policy/documentation/etc that have to be made will almost certainly improve our data environment
    * more campuses sign-on?
  * Milestones
    1. compile documentation and decide what we need to do to pass
    2. complete self-assessment and submit application
    3. make any further changes in response to PR
    4. get the certification

* Data metrics
  * Problem: researchers don't know whether anyone is actually using the data they publish
    * this is disheartening
    * researchers can't get credit for generating really useful datasets
    * potential re-users don't know whether anyone else has looked at this thing
    * t and p committees don't value data publication
  * Effort: Implement metrics via lagotto
    * API to supply downloads and views
    * harvest metrics from lagotto
    * display on dataset landing pages
  * Impact
    * researchers are more likely to share data openly because they know it's being used
    * demonstrated impact to them and to others
    * caring about metrics leads to caring about making useable datasets
  * Metrics of success
    * increased use of Dash?
    * Evidence that researchers care?
    * testing/survey to determine that researchers care?
  * Milestones
