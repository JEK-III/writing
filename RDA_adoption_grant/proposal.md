The California Digital Library is seeking funding to incorporate RDA Working Group Recommendations into our data preservation and publication service, Dash.
Dash enables researchers from six University of California Campuses to self-deposit data of any kind from any discipline to ensure preservation, enable citation via DOI, and enhance discoverability.
The Dash service is run using enirely open-source protocols; wherever possible, Dash components interact via standard protocols to enhance reusability.
Although Dash is already a reliable and functional service, we have identified two key areas where RDA Working Group Recommendations could help us to offer a higher level of service.
<!-- something about how we're currently revising -->


# Data metrics
We recognize that metrics of data impact/use are essential to incentivize data sharing by researchers.
The current Dash service does not collect or expose any metrics for the datasets or metadata records it contains.
The updated service will display a basic count of dataset downloads and metadata record page views.
While this is a good first step, the RDA-WDS Publishing Data Metrics Working group survey, as well as work carried out by the Making Data Count project, demonstrated that researchers and data managers value citations above all else.
Consequently, we are seeking to collect and display a more complete set of metrics for Dash datasets.

For this project, we will integrate Dash with an in-development data metrics service hosted by DataCite.
All Dash datasets are assigned DataCite DOIs.
We will modify Dash to collect ametrics in accordance with community standards being collected by the RDA Data Bibiliometrics Working Group.
