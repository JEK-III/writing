Making Data Count
Over the past year, the University of California Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library led a 1-year NSF-funded community project to advance dataset level metrics (DLM).
Science is built on a foundation of data, but recognition of data creation and publication as scholarship is limited by the lack of an essential prerequisite— accepted metrics of significance.
The aim of this effort was to prototype data metrics based on field research on data practices; test mechanisms of automatic tracking; explore ways in which raw DLM data can be delivered to drive data discovery across data types and research questions; and prototype a flexible DLM report for funders, institutions, and researchers.

Our current project consists of five main components:
•	Conduct in-depth field research and analyze existing surveys on data sharing practices and attitudes to define a set of practical and valuable metrics.
•	Extend the usage tracking capacity of DataONE to serve statistics that comply with industry standards.
• Extend existing technology– Lagotto, an open-source tool for tracking events around scholarly content– to begin harvesting data on these metrics.
•	Prototype tools for the community to use metrics in data discovery and assessment reporting and, where possible, to integrate the metrics into research papers.
•	Analyze metrics collected for datasets in the DataONE network and the Dryad repository to evaluate the suitability and viability across multiple research areas.
This work will be completed before the end of our grant period in February 2016.

Next Steps
The University of California Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library is seeking funding to continue DLM development and implementation, and to promote data metrics in the scholarly community.
Goals of this next project include:
• Expand the exisiting DLM application into a production DLM service to be hosted by DataCite.
• Explore collecting metrics from a larger and more heterogeneous pool of data repositories than the current pilot corpus.
• Use the compiled data as the basis for further research into data use, reuse, and attribution.
  Reexamine researcher-reported atittudes and practices in relation to data about actual practices.
• Collaborate with organizations such as CASRAI, NISO, and COUNTER to define and promote DLM standards.
• Leverage the experience of DataONE to support repositories in tracking and exposing standardized data use statistics.

Request
The University of California Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library requests a gift of USD $6000 to be used to facilitate these activities (travel, venue, logistics, etc.).





The University of California Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library would like to convene a group of experts in this field in April 2016.  The goal is to review our outputs, report on other areas of effort outside of our grant activity, and determine next steps for promoting data metrics in the scholarly community.
We plan to expand the group to include members from the funding community (Moore Foundation), the wider data infrastructure community (DataCite), and additional data metrics efforts (NISO, CASRAI, COUNTER).  Below is the proposed attendee list:
•	John Chodacki, Director of the University of California Curation Center (UC3), Executive Committee of COUNTER, and member of the CASRAI data level metrics working group
•	Stephen Abrams: Technical Director of the University of California Curation Center (UC3); PI on original NSF grant (#1448821)
•	John Kratz: Researcher at the University of California Curation Center (UC3); Lead on the RDA Data Bibliometrics working group
•	Patricia Cruse: Executive Director of Datacite
•	Martin Fenner: Technical Lead at Datacite; Member of the NISO group on alternative metrics; Chief Architect on the Lagotto open source application
•	Matt Jones: Director of Informatics Research and Development at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, University of California at Santa Barbara; DataONE Leadership Team member
•	Jennifer Lin: Director of Product Management at Crossref
•	Carly Strasser: Program Officer at Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation




Making Data Count: Developing a Data Metrics Service
The California Digital Library, DataCite, and DataONE will address what metrics will capture the activity surrounding research data in a valid and credible way.
We will design, develop, and prototype data metrics based on field research on data practices; test mechanisms of automatic tracking; explore ways in which the raw, dynamic dataset level metrics (DLM) data be delivered to drive data discovery across data types and research questions; and prototype a flexible report for funders, institutions, and researchers to share DLM results.

Researchers have long grappled with the problem of assessing and tracking the investment in and results of scholarship.
As new tools such as article-level metrics have enabled new views into the lifecycle of scholarly communication, the practice of evaluation has begun to incorporate such data and rapid change to the established system has followed.
The increased use of metrics has contributed to the recognition that individual objects of research output need distinct means of assessment to understand their role as work products.
This proposal will develop convention for addressing research data tracking. DLM will provide a clear and growing picture of the activity around, direct, first-hand views of the dissemination
of, and reach of research data.
These indicators capture the footprint of the data from the moment of deposition in a repository through to its dynamic evolution over time.
The results can be used to power data discovery by enabling new filtering and recommendation mechanisms so that researchers can better find the data most relevant to their specific needs.
DLM will provide a multidimensional view to accommodate a broad set of funder and institutional reporting needs.
DLM are automatically tracked, thus reducing the burden of reporting and potentially increasing consistency.
