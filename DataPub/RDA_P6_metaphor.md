#Do researchers belong at RDA? or Is electrical infrastructure the right metaphor?

## Mark parsons metaphor at e-Infrastructure day
* electrical socket: everyone knows what to do with it.
* other countries have other socket types: just plug in a converter and your good to go
* you don't need to know anything about what's behind the plug

## Andrew Treolar
* at TAB/co-chair meeting
* question from the audience: "where are the researchers at this meeting?"
* one I've hear before and had myself
* AT: there are meetings where engineers discuss step-down converters, whatever else, but I don't want to go to them.

## The problem with that idea
* the expectations around household electricity have been established for a long time, and are well understood by those people
* [US National Electrical Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electrical_Code) was first published in
* In the US 120V, reliably, don't blow anything up
* in the case of data, we don't have anything like that understanding

# Where AT is right
* v. few researchers are going to come to these things
* the ones that do will self-select: are likely to be power users
* good to serve these guys, but recognize that they aren't representative
* maybe meetings aren't the right way to figure this stuff out?
* more explicit engagement as a part of all of these projects?
* librarians?
* they won't come to you; you have to go to them
