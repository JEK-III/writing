#Dash abstract
To facilitate open data within the University of California system and beyond, the University of California Curation Center (UC3) is developing a new platform for our data curation and publication service, Dash.
Dash is a branded curation service for storing and sharing research data composed of the Merritt repository and a self-service repository overlay layer providing intuitive interfaces for submission and discovery of research datasets.
UC3 will continue to offer a Dash service, but in the future it will be implemented using new self-service overlay, called Stash.
While the current overlay is specific to the Merritt repository, Stash will be useable by any standards-compliant repository that supports the SWORD protocol for deposit and the OAI-PMH protocol for metadata harvesting.  

 Stash enables individual scholars to:
* Prepare datasets for curation by reviewing best practice guidance for the creation or acquisition of research data.
* Select data for curation through local file browse or drag-and-drop operation.
* Describe data in terms of scientifically-meaning metadata.
* Identify datasets for persistent citation, reference, and retrieval.Æ’
* Preserve, manage, and share data in an appropriate data repository.
* Discover, retrieve, and reuse data through faceted search and browse.

By alleviating many of the barriers that have historically precluded wider adoption of open data principles, Stash empowers individual scholars to assert active curation control over their research outputs; encourages more widespread data preservation, publication, sharing, and reuse; and promotes open scholarly inquiry and advancement.
